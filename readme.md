###  Javascript Datatypes
#### 7 Primitive Datatypes
- Number : Floating point numbers.
- String : Always in quotes.
- Boolean : True or false.
- Undefined : value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('Empty value') e.g `let children;`.
- Null : Also means 'empty value'.
- Symbol : defines value that is unique and cannot be changed.
- Bigint : Large integers that the Number type cannot hold
- `Javascript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the datatype of the value stored in a variable, instead, data types are determined automatically.`
- `Strings are printed in console in white color`
### Ways of declaring variables
- `let` is used to declare variables that can change later.
- `const` variable is used for variables that will not change in future. You cannot declare empty variables using variables
